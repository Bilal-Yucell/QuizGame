## About The Game And Gameplay

Mark the questions as true or false, there is no losing in this game, your goal is to learn!

NOTE: I can add menu, sound and music later. Actually, I wanted to learn better how to use the [SerializeField] and [Serializable] attributes and learn how to make a question and answer game.
